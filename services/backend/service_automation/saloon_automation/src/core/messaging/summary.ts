/**
 * Rolling conversation summary.
 *
 * History context to Claude is capped at the last N turns. For long-running
 * chats, important facts drop off the window — name, allergies, the service
 * they originally asked about. We keep a single-paragraph summary in
 * `conversations.summary` and refresh it every `SUMMARY_REFRESH_AFTER_TURNS`
 * messages. The summary gets prepended to the system prompt on each call.
 *
 * Refresh runs INLINE on the inbound request (cheap Haiku call, ~300 ms).
 * If the summary call itself fails we log and move on — the reply still
 * goes out with the recent window only.
