/**
 * Segment contract.
 *
 * A "segment" is a vertical (salon, restaurant, clinic, retail, …). One
 * codebase, many segments — each tenant picks one via `tenants.segment`.
 *
 * Implement this interface to add a new vertical:
 *   1. Create `src/segments/<name>/index.ts` exporting a `Segment` object.
 *   2. Register it in `src/segments/index.ts`.
 *   3. Add the name to the CHECK constraint in tenants migration.
 *   4. (Optional) Add segment-specific tables under supabase/migrations/.
 *
 * Keep the surface small. If a segment needs more than `buildSystemPrompt`
 * + `onAgentReply`, add a capability to this interface only after a second
 * segment also needs it.
